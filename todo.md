- [ ] MessageTableJoining (Join the registrations of 2 message tables).
- [ ] Config options (instead of constants)
- [ ] Add quick start example
- [ ] Add Cargo.toml dependency copy-pasta in docs.rs and GitHub.
- [x] Make send calls take an immutable reference by using a ReadWriteLock.
- [ ] `bevy-pigeon`, and `carrier-pigeon` might have enough documentation warrant a book.
- [ ] Bring back NetMsg and `impl<T: Any + Send + Sync + Serialize + DeserializeOwned> NetMsg for T;`
- [ ] Remove the Register custom, as custom `Serialize`/`Deserialize` impls are allowed.
- [ ] Remove the `<C, R, D>` generics as they end up everywhere.
